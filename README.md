## Lab Works:

### 1. Collecting and Crawling Data from Online Websites:

In this lab work, we explore techniques for collecting and crawling data from online websites. Using Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Requests, we demonstrate how to extract data from web pages, navigate through website structures, and scrape relevant information. The lab work includes hands-on exercises and examples to illustrate the process of web scraping and data collection.

### 2. Data Exploration and Analysis for WorldBank Dataset:

In this lab work, we delve into the exploration and analysis of the WorldBank dataset. We utilize Python's data manipulation and visualization libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA). Through data visualization and statistical analysis, we uncover insights, trends, and patterns within the dataset, gaining a deeper understanding of the socio-economic indicators provided by the WorldBank.

### 3. Using Deep Learning Tools (PyTorch) to Create Deep Learning Model for MNIST Handwritten Dataset:

In this lab work, we leverage deep learning tools, specifically PyTorch, to create a deep learning model for predicting handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset. We walk through the process of building a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, training the model on the MNIST dataset, and evaluating its performance. The lab work includes code examples, model training procedures, and performance evaluation metrics to assess the effectiveness of the deep learning approach.
